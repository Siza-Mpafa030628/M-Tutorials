        My name is Siza Mpafa, but I'm commonly known as SIZA M. With a passion for Mathematics, I decided to live up to the meaning of my name, 'Siza,' which means 'help'.
    </p>
    <p>
            I started hosting sessions called M-TUTORIALS to assist those struggling with Mathematics. Currently, I'm focusing on Matric students, as they can't afford to perform poorly in Mathematics on their National Senior Certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the beginning of the first term, I've been conducting these sessions and setting practice papers to assess their understanding of each topic.
         After testing them on individual topics, I realized it would be beneficial to administer a comprehensive test covering all topics learned each term. This test would simulate the actual Mathematics examination they'll face at the end of each term.
